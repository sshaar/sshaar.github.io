abstract: While COVID-19 vaccines are finally becoming widely available, a second
  pandemic that revolves around the circulation of anti-vaxxer ``fake newsâ€³ may hinder
  efforts to recover from the first one. With this in mind, we performed an extensive
  analysis of Arabic and English tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, with focus on messages
  originating from Qatar. We found that Arabic tweets contain a lot of false information
  and rumors, while English tweets are mostly factual. However, English tweets are
  much more propagandistic than Arabic ones. In terms of propaganda techniques, about
  half of the Arabic tweets express doubt, and 1/5 use loaded language, while English
  tweets are abundant in loaded language, exaggeration, fear, name-calling, doubt,
  and flag-waving. Finally, in terms of framing, Arabic tweets adopt a health and
  safety perspective, while in English economic concerns dominate.
