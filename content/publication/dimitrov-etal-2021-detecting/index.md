abstract: 'Propaganda can be defined as a form of communication that aims to influence
  the opinions or the actions of people towards a specific goal; this is achieved
  by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Propaganda, in the
  form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th century. However,
  it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media that propaganda has started
  to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming major societal and political
  issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in social media is multimodal, mixing
  textual with visual content. With this in mind, here we propose a new multi-label
  multimodal task: detecting the type of propaganda techniques used in memes. We further
  create and release a new corpus of 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda
  techniques, which can appear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis
  of the corpus shows that understanding both modalities together is essential for
  detecting these techniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several
  state-of-the-art multimodal models.'
