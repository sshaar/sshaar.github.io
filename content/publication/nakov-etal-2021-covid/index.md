abstract: With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political and the medical
  aspects of disinformation merged as the problem got elevated to a whole new level
  to become the first global infodemic. Fighting this infodemic is currently ranked
  very high on the list of priorities of the World Health Organization, with dangers
  ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading
  xenophobia and panic. With this in mind, we studied how COVID-19 is discussed in
  Bulgarian social media in terms of factuality, harmfulness, propaganda, and framing.
  We found that most Bulgarian tweets contain verifiable factual claims, are factually
  true, are of potential public interest, are not harmful, and are too trivial to
  fact-check; moreover, zooming into harmful tweets, we found that they spread not
  only rumors but also panic. We further analyzed articles shared in Bulgarian partisan
  pro/con-COVID-19 Facebook groups and found that propaganda is more prevalent in
  skeptical articles, which use doubt, flag waving, and slogans to convey their message;
  in contrast, concerned ones appeal to emotions, fear, and authority; moreover, skeptical
  articles frame the issue as one of quality of life, policy, legality, economy, and
  politics, while concerned articles focus on health & safety. We release our manually
  and automatically analyzed datasets to enable further research.
