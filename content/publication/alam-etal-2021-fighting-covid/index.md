abstract: With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the political and the medical
  aspects of disinformation merged as the problem got elevated to a whole new level
  to become the first global infodemic. Fighting this infodemic has been declared
  one of the most important focus areas of the World Health Organization, with dangers
  ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading
  xenophobia and panic. Addressing the issue requires solving a number of challenging
  problems such as identifying messages containing claims, determining their check-worthiness
  and factuality, and their potential to do harm as well as the nature of that harm,
  to mention just a few. To address this gap, we release a large dataset of 16K manually
  annotated tweets for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i) focuses on COVID-19,
  (ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers,
  social media platforms, policy makers, and society, and (iii) covers Arabic, Bulgarian,
  Dutch, and English. Finally, we show strong evaluation results using pretrained
  Transformers, thus confirming the practical utility of the dataset in monolingual
  vs. multilingual, and single task vs. multitask settings.
