abstract: 'Recent years have seen the proliferation of disinformation and fake news
  online. Traditional approaches to mitigate these issues is to use manual or automatic
  fact-checking. Recently, another approach has emerged: checking whether the input
  claim has previously been fact-checked, which can be done automatically, and thus
  fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to the human fact-checking
  and explanations in the associated fact-checking article. Here, we focus on claims
  made in a political debate and we study the impact of modeling the context of the
  claim: both on the source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side,
  i.e., in the fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local
  context, the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and
  multi-hop reasoning over the sentences of the document describing the fact-checked
  claim. The experimental results show that each of these represents a valuable information
  source, but that modeling the source-side context is most important, and can yield
  10+ points of absolute improvement over a state-of-the-art model.'
