abstract: 'We describe SemEval-2021 task 6 on Detection of Persuasion Techniques in
  Texts and Images: the data, the annotation guidelines, the evaluation setup, the
  results, and the participating systems. The task focused on memes and had three
  subtasks: (i) detecting the techniques in the text, (ii) detecting the text spans
  where the techniques are used, and (iii) detecting techniques in the entire meme,
  i.e., both in the text and in the image. It was a popular task, attracting 71 registrations,
  and 22 teams that eventually made an official submission on the test set. The evaluation
  results for the third subtask confirmed the importance of both modalities, the text
  and the image. Moreover, some teams reported benefits when not just combining the
  two modalities, e.g., by using early or late fusion, but rather modeling the interaction
  between them in a joint model.'
